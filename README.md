## Overview

This project automates the process of fetching book chapters from the web, processing the text using AI, allowing a human review step, and saving multiple versions of the content.  
It is developed using **Python, Playwright, FastAPI, and ChromaDB** as part of the Agentic AI task assignment.

---

## Key Features

- **Scraping:** Extract book content and save text with a screenshot.  
- **AI Writer:** Perform basic AI-powered text transformation.  
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Allows manual editing of AI-generated text.  
- **FastAPI UI:** Web interface to trigger each process step.  
- **Database Versioning:** Store and retrieve different text versions.
